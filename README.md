Getting Started

To get started with OMNI ROM, you'll need to get familiar with Git and Repo.

To initialize your local repository using the OMNIROM trees, use a command like this:

repo init -u git://github.com/omnirom/android.git -b <branch>

Then to sync up: repo sync

Then to build: cd <source-dir>; . build/envsetup.sh; brunch <device_name>
